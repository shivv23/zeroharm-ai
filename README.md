# ZeroHarm AI — Industrial Safety Intelligence Platform

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

**ZeroHarm AI** is a multi-agent industrial safety intelligence platform that detects compound risks before they become catastrophes. Built for the **ET AI Hackathon 2026** — Problem Statement 1: AI-Powered Industrial Safety Intelligence for Zero-Harm Operations.

---

## The Problem

On January 20, 2025, the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant suffered a catastrophic explosion. Eight workers died. Twelve were injured. The root cause? Gas pressure sensors showed warning signals — but no intelligence layer connected those readings to operational decisions. A permit-to-work was issued without checking real-time sensor data. Maintenance proceeded despite abnormal gas accumulation.

**Sensor data without an intelligence layer is just noise.**

---

## The Solution

ZeroHarm AI bridges the gap between raw sensor data and safety-critical decisions through a multi-agent architecture:

- **Compound Risk Detection Engine** correlates sensor readings, permit activity, and maintenance status to detect compound risks — conditions where multiple minor issues combine into a critical threat
- **Digital Twin Aggregator** combines all subsystems into a unified plant health dashboard
- **Real-time WebSocket push** delivers risk scores, alerts, and health metrics every 2 seconds
- **Interactive simulation** through What-If and Emergency Response modules
- **Machine Learning** for anomaly detection (Isolation Forest) and predictive risk forecasting

## Deployment

### Live Demo

- **Frontend:** [http://13.59.83.134](http://13.59.83.134)
- **Backend API:** [http://13.59.83.134/api/health](http://13.59.83.134/api/health)
- **API Docs:** [http://13.59.83.134:8000/docs](http://13.59.83.134:8000/docs)
- **Default Login:** `admin` / `admin123`

### Docker (Self-Hosted)

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
# Backend: http://localhost:8000
# Frontend: http://localhost:80
# API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

The application runs in two containers behind an nginx reverse proxy:
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Uvicorn ASGI server (port 8000, internal)
- **Frontend:** Static React build served by nginx (port 80, public), with `/api/` paths proxied to the backend
- **Database:** SQLite persisted via Docker named volume (`zeroharm_data`)
- **WebSocket:** Real-time state updates every 2 seconds (connect at `ws://host/ws`)

Set optional environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:
- `JWT_SECRET` — Secret key for token signing
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — Comma-separated CORS origins (only needed for direct backend access)
